scalatags-ext
=============

Extensions to scalatags.

This project adds commonly-useful stuff on top of scalatags, including reactive bindings for the dom
harvested and adapted from elsewere. It's hoped that some or all of this functionality will migrate into
scalatags, or a more centrally maintained project.
